methods_long: "This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular\
  \ intervention strategies. The model consists of two processes. The first process\
  \ is a statistical model of how the  number of COVID-19 infections changes over\
  \ time. The second process maps the number of  infections to the reported data.\_\
  We model the growth of new cases as the product of a  dynamic growth parameter and\
  \ the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected cases  in the population at\
  \ the previous time step, scaled by the size of the state's starting  susceptible\
  \ population. The growth parameter can be thought of as the transmissibility of\
  \  the virus in that state on that date. To model new deaths in the population,\
  \ we assume that a  fraction of the newly generated cases will die and learn that\
  \ fraction from observations.  We can also anticipate when the outbreak is likely\
  \ to peak, i.e.\_when the daily number of new  confirmed cases reaches its maximum.\""

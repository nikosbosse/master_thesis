methods_long: 'This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future
  COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios,
  each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the
  future.  This submission is the selection of the weekly scenario we believe to be
  most plausible given current observations and planned intervention policies.  The
  selected scenarios are listed below: June 14 - present ''5_2xhold'': This scenario
  assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week,
  the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.   June
  7 ''80contact1x5p'' : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with
  growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase
  in states that have reopened. May 7 - June 4 ''80contactw5p'': For states maintaining
  or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions
  of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a
  weekly 5% increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. May 3 ''80contact1x10p'':
  For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we
  apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in
  states that reopen, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during
  the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate
  for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 ''70contact'': This scenario
  mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g.
  school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation
  (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections,
  all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction.
  Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact
  rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had
  previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number
  of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact
  rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario. '

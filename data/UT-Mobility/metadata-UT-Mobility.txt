team_model_designation: primary
methods: This model makes predictions assuming that social distancing patterns, as
  measured by anonymized mobile-phone GPS traces,  remain constant in the future.This
  model models only *first-wave deaths*.
team_funding: NSF
data_inputs: JHU CSSE
methods_long: For each US state, we use local data from mobile-phone GPS traces made
  available by [SafeGraph] to quantify the changing impact of social-distancing measures
  on ``flattening the curve.''  SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized
  location data from numerous applications in order to provide insights about physical
  places. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if
  fewer than five devices visitedan establishment in a month from a given census block
  group.  These data are aggregated by state to create metrics of social distancing,
  which are used as predictors in the model. We use a Bayesian multilevel negative
  binomial regression model for the number of deaths for each day, and implement the
  model in R using the rstanarm package. See technical report at https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/media/filer_public/87/63/87635a46-b060-4b5b-a3a5-1b31ab8e0bc6/ut_covid-19_mortality_forecasting_model_latest.pdf

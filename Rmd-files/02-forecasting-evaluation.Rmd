# Forecasting and evaluation {#evaluation}

Model evaluation is an integral of the forecasting process that can provide us with valuable insights. It can help us to choose between different models, but also give us a better understanding of how a model works and how it can be improved. The evaluation metrics discussed here also form the basis to combine models into an ensemble that works better than all individual models. This chapter therefore provides the theoretical foundation for the discussion of model aggregation in Chapter \@ref(model-aggregation) and for the analysis presented in Chapter \@ref(results). It first gives a brief overview of different types of forecasts to provide a background for the remainder of this chapter. It then reviews the forecasting paradigm as formulated by @gneitingCalibratedProbabilisticForecasting2005 and @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007 that is at the core of forecast evaluation. The forecast paradigm states that a forecaster should aim to maximise the *sharpness* of their forecast subject to *calibration*. We therefore present different ways to assess these two properties, followed by a discussion of proper scoring rules that allow us to summarise the quality of a forecast in a single number. Finally, we propose a structured evaluation framework based on the notions discussed in this chapter and present the `scoringuitls` package in more detail that facilitates the evaluation process. We illustrate the concepts discussed throughout this chapter using examples from the COVIDhub-baseline model, one of the Forecast Hub models. The examples use data from a longer time frame than the one analysed in Chapter \@ref(results) and serve illustrative purposes only. 

## An overview of differenct forecast types {#forecast-types}

A forecast is the forecasterâ€™s stated belief about the future. In terms of quantitative forecasts we can distinguish point forecasts from probabilistic forecasts. A point forecast states a single number and is the simplest form of a forecast. It can, in essence, be understood as an estimate for the mean of the unknown true data-generating distribution. A point forecast is limited in its usefulness, as it does not state any uncertainty around the mean forecast. A very certain forecasts may warrant a very different course of actions than does a very uncertain ones. Providing uncertainty around a forecast therefore increases its usefulness. Ideally, however, predictions should be stated in terms of the entire predictive distributions [@gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007]. Such a forecast is then called a probabilistic forecast. Providing the entire predictive distribution allows the forecaster to express their belief about all aspects of the underlying data-generating distribution (including e.g. skewness or the width of its tails). 

These forecasts can also be reported in different formats that all require slightly different evaluation approaches. The predictive distribution can be expressed analytically, is oftentimes represented by a set of predictive samples from that distribution. This is especially useful as the forecaster can use methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to generate predictions if no analytical expression of the predictive distribution is available. The downside is that predictive samples take a lot of storage space. They also come with a loss of precision that is especially pronounced in the tails of the predictive distribution, where we need quite a lot of samples to characterise the distribution accurately. To circumvent these problems, often quantiles of the predictive distribution are reported instead. Quantile forecasts can easily be obtained from the explicit analytical form of a probalistic forecasts as well as from predictive samples. A forecaster could also in principle state their forecasts in a binary way by defining an outcome and assigning a probability that the outcome will come true. This type of forecasting is common in many classification problems, but will not be discussed further here. If we think of the outcome of some number being larger or smaller than a certain value, however, we can see that binary predictions are naturally related to the concept of a cumulative distribution function (CDF). 

## The forecasting paradigm

Any forecaster should aim to minimise the difference between the predictive distribution and the unknown true data-generating distribution [@gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007]. For an ideal forecast, we therefore have 
$$ P_t = F_t, $$
where $P_t$ is the the cumulative density function (CDF) of the predictive distribution at time $t$ and $F_t$ is the CDF of the true, unknown data-generating distribution. As we don't know the true data-generating distribution, we cannot assess the difference between the two distributions directly. @gneitingCalibratedProbabilisticForecasting2005 and @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007 instead suggest to focus on two central aspects of the predictive distribution, *calibration* and *sharpness*. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the predictive distribution and the observations. There are different possible ways in which a model can be (mis-)calibrated [@gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007], but for the remainder of this thesis it suffices to say that a well calibrated forecast does not systematically deviate from the observed values. Sharpness is a feature of the forecast only and describes how concentrated the predictive distribution is, i.e. how precise the forecasts are. The general forecasting paradigm states that we should *maximise sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration*. Take for example the task of predicting rainfall in a city like London. A model that made very precise forecasts would not be useful if the forecasts were wrong most of the time. On the other hand, a model that predicts the same rainfall probability for every day can be correct on average^[To be precise, this model would be marginally calibrated according to @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007], but is also less useful than a model that were able to accurately predict the weather every single day. Figure \@ref(fig:forecast-paradigm) illustrates the concepts of calibration and sharpness once again. 

``` {r forecast-paradigm, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Illustration of the forecasting paradigm that states we should maximise sharpness subject to calibration. Shown are different predictive distributions that predict the true value at x = 0."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/forecast-paradigm.png")

```



The following sections look at calibration and sharpness in more detail. We first discuss different ways to assess these two properties independently. This can give the forecaster a better understanding of how their forecasts could be improved. Then, we introduce proper scoring rules that allow us to represent the quality of a forecast in one numeric value. 


## Assessing calibration 

In absence of knowledge of the true data-generating distribution we can never prove calibration, but only look for absence of miscalibration. Several strategies have been proposed to detect systematic deviations of the predictive distributions from the observations (see e.g. @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019; @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007). In order to get a clearer picture of the different ways in which a model can be miscalibrated, it makes sense to look at calibration from more than one angle. In the following we explore three different ways to approach calibration. The first one is bias, i.e. systematic over- or underprediction. The second one is empirical coverage. Coverage measures what proportion of the observed values is covered by different parts of the predictive distribution. The third is the probability integral transform (PIT), a transformation of the original observed values that allows us to assess calibration more easily. 

### Calibration and bias

Systematic over- or underprediction is a very common form of miscalibration. It therefore makes sense to dedicate separate attention to the detection of systematic biases. We present three different bias metrics, each slightly adapted for continuous, integer and quantile forecasts. 

For continuous forecasts, assessing whether a predictive distribution has a tendency to over- or underpredict can be very easily achieved by simply evaluating the predictive distribution at the true observed value. This metric is a generalisation of the integer-valued one @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 have proposed earlier. It is also closely related to the probability integral transform (PIT) discussed later in this chapter. To improve the interpretability of the score we can transform it to a value between -1 (under-prediction) and 1 (over-prediction). Consequently, we measure bias as
$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - 2 \cdot (P_t (x_t)),$$
where $P_t$ is the cumulative distribution function of the predictive distribution for the true value $x_t$. When using predictive samples, $P_t (x_t)$ is simply the fraction of predictive samples for $x_t$ that are smaller than the true observed $x_t$.

For integer valued forecasts, we use the metric proposed by @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019: 
$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - (P_t (x_t) + P_t (x_t + 1)).$$
Bias can again assume values between -1 (under-prediction) and 1 (over-prediction) and is 0 ideally. 

For quantile forecasts, we propose the following metric to assess bias: 
\begin{align*}
  B_t &= (1 - 2 \cdot \max \{i | q_{t,i} \in Q_t \land q_{t,i} \leq x_t\}) \mathbb{1}( x_t \leq q_{t, 0.5}) \\
  &+ (1 - 2 \cdot \min \{i | q_{t,i} \in Q_t \land q_{t,i} \geq x_t\}) \mathbb{1}( x_t \geq q_{t, 0.5}),
\end{align*}
where $Q_t$ is the set of quantiles that form the predictive distribution at time $t$. They represent our belief about what the true value $x_t$ will be. For consistency, we define $Q_t$ such that it always includes the element $q_{t, 0} = - \infty$ and $q_{t,1} = \infty$. $\mathbb{1}()$ is the indicator function that is $1$ if the condition is satisfied and $0$ otherwise. In clearer terms, $B_t$ is defined as the maximum percentile rank for which the corresponding quantile is still below the true value, if the true value is smaller than the median of the predictive distribution. If the true value is above the median of the predictive distribution, then $B_t$ is the minimum percentile rank for which the corresponding quantile is still larger than the true value. If the true value is exactly the median, both terms cancel out and $B_t$ is zero. For a large enough number of quantiles, the percentile rank will equal the proportion of predictive samples below the observed true value, and this metric coincides with the one for continuous forecasts. Figure \ref{fig:bias-example} exemplifies a possible visualisation of bias for one-week-ahead predictions made by the COVIDhub-baseline model. 

``` {r bias-example, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "One week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model for the US (top) and corresponding bias values (bottom). Observations are shown in black, median predictions ar marked by white points, ribbons show the 50 percent and 90 percent prediction intervals."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/bias_example.png")

```

### Calibration and empirical coverage

Another way to look at calibration^[precisely: probabilistic calibration in @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007] is to compare the proportion of observed values covered by different parts of the predictive distribution with the nominal coverage implied by the CDF of the distribution. This is most easily understood in the context of quantile forecasts, but can in principle be transferred to continuous and integer forecasts as well. 

To assess empirical coverage at a certain interval range, we simply measure the proportion of true observed values that fall into corresponding range of the predictive distribution. If the 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles are given, then 50% of the true values should fall between the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles and 90% should fall between the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles. We can calculate and plot these values to inspect how well different parts of the forecast distribution are calibrated. This is illustrated in the left plot in Figure \@ref(fig:coverage) where the empirical coverage of the US forecasts of the COVIDhub-baseline model is shown. We can seen that the interval coverage for the outer prediction intervals looks reasonable, but inner prediction intervals seem to miss too many observations. 

``` {r coverage, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.show = "hold", fig.cap = "Empirical coverage of prediction intervals (left) and coverage of quantiles of the predictive distribution (right) for one week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/interval-coverage.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/quantile-coverage.png")

```

To get an even more precise picture, we can also look at the percentage of true values below every single quantile of the predictive distribution. This type of visualisation allows us to diagnose problematic aspects more accurately, as is illustrated on the right in Figure \@ref(fig:coverage). This plot allows us to describe the problem more precisely as an upward bias of large parts of the predictive distribution, but not the lower tails. 

### Calibration and the probability integral transform

As explained earlier, the CDF of predictice distribution $P_t$ should ideally be equal to the CDF of the true unknown distribution $F_t$ that generated the observed value $x_t$. In order to assess whether there are substantial deviations between the two, @dawidPresentPositionPotential1984 suggested to transform the observed values using the probability integral transform (PIT). Agreement between the forecasts and the observed values can then be examined by observing whether or not the transformed values follow a uniform distribution. The PIT is given by 
$$u_t = P_t (x_t),$$
where $u_t$ is the transformed variable and $P_t(x_t)$ is the predictive distribution evaluated at the true observed value $x_t$. If $P_t = F_t$ at all times $t$, then $u_t, t = 1 \dots T$ follows a uniform distribution (for a proof see e.g. @angusProbabilityIntegralTransform1994). 

In the case of discrete outcomes, the PIT is no longer uniform even when forecasts are ideal. As @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 suggest, we use a randomised PIT instead by redefining 
$$u_t = P_t(x_t) + vt \cdot (P_t(x_t) - P_t(x_t - 1) ),$$
where $x_t$ is again the observed value at time $t$, $P_t()$ is the CDF of the predictive distribution function, $P_t (-1) = 0$ by definition, and $v_t$ is a standard uniform variable independent of $x_t$. If $P_t$ is equal to the true data-generating distribution function, then $u_t$ is standard uniform. @czadoPredictiveModelAssessment2009 also propose a non-randomised version of the PIT for count data that could be used alternatively. 

One can then plot a histogram of $u_t$ values to look for deviations from uniformity. U-shaped histograms often result from predictions that are too narrow, while hump-shaped histograms indicate that predictions may be too wide. Biased predictions will usually result in a triangle-shaped histogram. Figure \@ref(fig:pit-examples) shows four different simulated example PIT histograms that illustrate these characteristics. 
``` {r pit-examples, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.asp = 0.7, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Four examples of different predictive distributions and the correspoding PIT histograms below. The data always follows the same Normal(0,1) distribution. Preditive distributions are indicated by the title of the subplot."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/calibration-examples.png")

```
In addition to the visual inspection, @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 suggest to apply an Anderson-Darling [@andersonAsymptoticTheoryCertain1952] test for uniformity to the transformed values. The test cannot prove uniformity, but only assess whether there is evidence against it. As a rule of thumb, Funk et al. suggest there is no evidence to call a forecasting model miscalibrated if the p-value found was greater than a threshold of $p \geq 0.1$, some evidence that it is miscalibrated if $0.01 < p < 0.1$, and good evidence that it is miscalibrated if $p \leq 0.01$. This approach, however, may be overly conservative^[To test this, we ran a small simulation study with i = 1 000 iterations. For every iteration, n = 1 000 true values were simulated from a standard normal distribution. Each of these true values was then 'predicted' using s = 10 000 samples from the same standard normal distribution. For every iteration i we therefore obtained 1 000 true values and 1 000 predictive distributions (with 10 000 samples each). These 1 000 true values very transformed using the probability integral transform, which again yielded 1 000 transformed values for every iteration. On these values, we then applied the Anderson-Darling test for uniformity and recorded the p-value. Out of 1000 iterations, there were 165 p-values $\leq 0.01$, 88 p-values $0.01 < p < 0.1$ and 747 p-values $\leq 0.01$. Note that 1000 true values is quite high for many applied settings. For n = 100 true_values and s = 2000 samples, the result was 108, 87 and 805. Based on this limited evidence can we can conclude that there is at least a chance that the AD test may be prone to reject a meaningful fraction of well calibrated predictions.] and should not be used as the sole criterion to judge calibration of a forecast. 

@hamillInterpretationRankHistograms2001 discusses in length that uniformity of the PIT histogram is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for calibration. Nevertheless, the PIT histogram can give us a good impression of the reliability of our forecasts. Figure \@ref(fig:pit-baseline-model) shows the pit histogram for one-week-ahead predictions made by the COVIDhub-baseline model across different states. We can see that the PIT histogram presents a pattern that suggests under-dispersion may be present, i.e. at least some of the confidence intervals may be too narrow. This corresponds well to the observation made in the coverage plot in Figure \@ref(fig:coverage). 

(ref:nloptr) using the `nloptr` package [@R-nloptr]

``` {r pit-baseline-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "PIT histogram for one-week-ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model. In order to obtain samples from the quantiles provided, a separate gamma distribution was first fit to every set of quantiles provided to the Forecast Hub (ref:nloptr). Samples were then drawn from these distributions. We can see a pattern commonly found in underdispersed predictions"}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/pit-baseline-model.png")

```

## Assessing sharpness

Sharpness is the second property central to model evaluation. The ability to produce narrow forecasts is a quality of the forecasts only and does not depend on the observations. Sharpness is therefore only of interest conditional on calibration: a very precise forecast is not useful if it is clearly wrong. Again we need to take slightly different approaches for continuous, integer and quantile forecasts. For continuous and integer forecasts we follow the suggestion from @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019. For quantile forecasts we propose a novel metric. 

For continuous and integer forecasts, @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 suggest to measure sharpness as the normalised median absolute deviation about the median (MADN), i.e. 
$$ S_t(P_t) = \frac{1}{0.675} \cdot \text{median}(|y - \text{median(y)}|), $$ 
where $y$ is the vector of all predictive samples and $\frac{1}{0.675}$ is a normalising constant that ensures that sharpness will equal the standard deviation of the predictive distribution if $P_t$ is the CDF of a normal distribution. 

For quantile forecasts, we propose to measure sharpness as a weighted mean of the width of the interval ranges. Let $Q_t$ be a set of predicted quantiles for a true $x_t$ at time $t$. This set of quantiles is assumed to be symmetric, such that there exist $K$ corresponding pairs of elements $q_{t, \frac{\alpha}{2}}$ and $q_{t, 1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$. These $K$ corresponding pairs of quantiles cover a $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100$ prediction interval. We can, accordingly, also denote $q_{t, \frac{\alpha}{2}}$ as $l_t$ the lower bound of the prediction interval at time $t$ and $q_{t, 1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ as $u_t$, the upper bound. We measure the sharpness of a quantile forecast at time $t$ as
\begin{align*}
\text{sharpness}_t &= \frac{1}{K} \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\alpha}{2} (q_{t, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} - q_{t, \frac{\alpha}{2}}) \\
                   &= \frac{1}{K} \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\alpha}{2} (u_t - l_t).
\end{align*}
Weighting the width of different intervals with $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ ensures that the score does not grow indefinitely for very large prediction intervals, and correspondingly, very small $\alpha$. We also argue that this sharpness metric for quantile forecasts is a natural choice for quantile forecasts as it corresponds to the sharpness component of the Weighted Interval Score  described in the following section.


## Proper scoring rules

Instead of assessing calibration and sharpness independently, we can make use of proper scoring rules to express the quality of our forecast in a single number. Propriety is a feature of a score that guarantees that the ideal forecast will always on average receive the lowest score [@gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007]. A forecaster judged by a proper scoring rule is therefore always incentivised to make forecasts as close to the true data-generating distribution as possible. Proper scoring rules are closely related to the forecasting paradigm, as any proper scoring rule for finite-valued targets can be decomposed into a component that evaluates sharpness and one that scores calibration [@brockerReliabilitySufficiencyDecomposition2009a; @hersbachDecompositionContinuousRanked2000]. Different scoring rules, however, may weigh sharpness and calibration differently and therefore yield different results. The following sections present three different proper scoring rules: the Log Score, the (Continuous) Ranked Probability Score and the (Weighted) Interval Score. 

### Log Score

The Log Score is one of the oldest proper scoring rules and can be traced back to @shannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948 and his work on communication and information theory and to @goodRationalDecisions1952 who first proposed a log score for binary predictions. The Log Score is now widely used in all sorts of fields, especially in Bayesian inference [@gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014]. The log score is simply the log density of the predictive distribution at time $t$ evaluated at the true observed value: 
$$ \text{log score}_t = \log p_t(x_t),$$
where $p_t$ is the predictive density function at time $t$. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:log-score}. One problem with the log score is that it becomes numerically unstable for values of $p_t(x_t)$ close to zero. The log score will therefore not play a large role in this thesis, but is mentioned for completeness sake as it of great importance to many applications. It also quite nicely illustrates the concept of looking at observations in terms of the predictive distribution that we already saw in the PIT. 

``` {r log-score, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Illustration of the Log score as the log predictive density evaluated at the true observed value."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/log-score-example.png")

```


### (Continuous) Ranked Probability Score

The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) [@mathesonScoringRulesContinuous1976; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007] is a proper scoring rule that is considered more stable and therefore better suited for our purposes. Intuitively, we can think of the CRPS as a measure of the distance between the CDFs of the predictive distribution and the data-generating distribution. Smaller values are therfore preferable. The CRPS is defined as 
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:crps)
\text{CRPS}(P_t, x_t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( P(y) - \mathbb{1}(y \geq x_t) \right)^2 dy,
\end{equation}
where $P_t$ is again the CDF of the predictive distribution and $x_t$ is the true observed value. 

The CRPS can also be expressed as 
$$ \text{CRPS}(P_t, x_t) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{P_t} |X - X'| - \mathbb{E}_P |X - x_t|, $$
where $X$ and $X'$ are independent realisations from the predictive distributions $P_t$ with finite first moment (@gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007). This formulation is convenient as we can simply replace $X$ and $X'$ with predictive samples and sum over all possible combinations to obtain the desired sample CRPS. 

For integer counts, we can use the Ranked Probability Score (RPS) as proposed by @epsteinScoringSystemProbability1969 and  @murphyRankedProbabilityScore1969, and discussed e.g. by @czadoPredictiveModelAssessment2009. The RPS is defined as 
$$ \text{RPS}(P_t, x_t) = \sum_{y = 0}^\infty (P_t(y) - \mathbb{1} (y \geq x_t))^2. $$
Figure \@ref(fig:crps-explanation) gives an intuitive illustration of the CRPS. For the case of a point prediction, as shown in the top half, the CRPS is equal to the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the point forecast. In this case the predictive distribution degenerates to a distribution with its entire mass on the single predicted point and the CDF of the predictive distribution becomes a step function. The CRPS then equals the area between the true observed value and the predicted value (as $1^2 = 1$ and the height of the rectangle is again 1). For other distributions, as shown in the bottom half, this does not hold exactly, as $P_t()$ is squared in Equation \@ref(eq:crps). Intuitively, we can nevertheless understand the CRPS as a measure related to the vertical distance between the predictive CDF and the true data-generating distribution.  

(ref:crps) \@ref(eq:crps)

``` {r crps-explanation, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Illustration of the CRPS. Top: CRPS for a predictive distribution with its entire mass on the predicted value, $1$. The CRPS corresponds to the mean absolute error of the point prediction. This is the absolute difference between the predicted value, 1, and the true observed value, 0, as the height of the shaded square is one. Bottom: llustration that gives an intuition of the CRPS as a measure related to the vertical distance between the CDF and the true value. Note that the CRPS does not in fact equal the shaded area, as the term in Equation (ref:crps) is squared."}

```

### Interval score

The Interval Score is a proper scoring rule to evaluate predictions in a quantile format [@bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2020; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007]. Let us consider a pair of predictive quantiles $q_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}, q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ that form a $(1 - \alpha) * 100$ prediction interval. Let us denote $q_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, the lower bound, as $l$, and $q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, the upper bound, as $u$. Then the Interval score is given as 
$$\text{IS}_{\alpha} = (u - l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l - x) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \leq l) 
+ \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (x - u) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \geq u).$$
This score can be separated into three parts: $(u - l)$ measures the sharpness of the predictive distribution. $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l - x) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \leq l)$ and $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (x - u) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \geq u)$ are penalties that occur if the observed value falls below the lower or above the upper end of the interval range. These over- and underprediction penalties give us a second way to characterise the bias of a forecast. Whereas the bias metric presented previously looked for the innermost quantile that included the observation, the Interval Score  captures the actual difference between the forecast and the observed value whenever a forecast falls outside the prediction interval. For the median prediction^[To simplify notation, we treat the the median as a 0% interval range represented by the pair of quantiles $(q_\frac{1}{2}, q_\frac{1}{2})$.], forecast has a sharpness of zero and the Interval Score is proportional to the MAE. 

Usually, more than one predictive interval is reported at once. For a set of $K$ quantile pairs, we can obtain the overall Interval Score  as a (weighted) average of individual Interval Score  contributions:
$$ \text{IS} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_\alpha w_\alpha \cdot \text{IS}_\alpha.$$ 
This Interval Score  is proper for any non-negative choice of $w_\alpha$. For $w_\alpha = \frac{\alpha}{2}$, one can show that the Interval Score  converges to the CRPS for an increasing set of equally spaced prediction intervals [@bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2020]. It is this particular version of the Interval Score  with $w_\alpha = \frac{\alpha}{2}$ that we refer to when we mention the 'Weighted Interval Score' (WIS) or simply 'Interval Score ' throughout the remainder of this thesis.

## A proposed evaluation framework

The previous sections have introduced a variety of different metrics that can help to highlight different important aspects of model performance. Based on these individual building blocks we propose the following structured approach to model evaluation: 

1. Visualise the observed data as well as the predictions to get a feeling for how individual models perform. Revisit these plots at each step of the evaluation process. 
2. Obtain an overall model ranking and a first indication of where potential problems with individual models lie. To that end, look at summarised scores for all metrics and proper scoring rules. Apply a mixed-effefts regression with the Interval Score s as dependent variable and with models and other appropriate variables as predictors. To our knowledge, Jacob Bien and Evan Ray were the first to propose this framework in an informal setting as part of their work for the Forecast Hub. The regression can be very helpful in terms of model selection and differntiation, but also as a first step to identify the main drivers of performance differences, e.g. between different locations. 
3. Analyse the main contributors and factors that drive differences in scores. It makes sense to divide this analysis into external drivers, like different locations or time points that cause difficulties to all models, and innate properties of the models themselves. 
    a) Look at external drivers by identifying settings (e.g. locations, forecast dates) that induce models to be more or less calibrated or seem to be harder to forecast.
    b) Identify model characteristics that lead to better or worse performance. To that end, examine plots for bias, coverage, and sharpness as well as PIT histograms in detail. This analysis can provide important feedback for model improvement. 
4. Look again at visualisations of predictions versus observations to sense check the evaluation results and analysis aspects in detail that are left unclear. 

This structured evaluation approach will guide the evaluation of the Forecast Hub models and the ensembles in Chapter \@ref(results). 

## The scoringutils package

The structured model evaluation approach outlined in the last section is greatly facilitated through the `scoringutils` package [@R-scoringutils]. The package makes all metrics described in this chapter easily available to the user who can automatically apply the appropriate metrics to a forecast. It also allows for simple aggregation over arbitrary subgroups which makes summarising, plotting and fitting a regression very convenient. 

The stable version of the package is available on CRAN, the development version can be found on github^[[github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils](https://github.com/epiforecasts/scoringutils)]. Internally, `scoringutils` uses `data.table` to allow for an efficient handling of large data.frames. The package is extensively documented, has example data and a vignette that walks the user through all relevant steps. 

Evaluation metrics in the package can be accessed in two different ways.  They can either be used independently from each other in a format built around vectors and matrices. Alternatively, users can decide to have forecasts automatically scored in a `data.frame` format through the function `eval_forecast`. 

The function `eval_forecast` takes in a `data.frame` with predictions and true observed values. Users then specify the unit of a single observation with the `by` argument that takes in a character vector with different column names. If predictions are for example made on different forecast dates by several models for several locations over different horizons, then the user should specify `by = c("model", "forecast_date", "location", "horizon")`. Scores can be aggregated over different groups using `summarise_by`. If we are only interested in the score per model, we would specify `summarise_by = c("model")`. The `quantiles` argument allows us to summarise the aggregated scores by a set of quantiles. This is especially useful for plotting. 

The following snippet shows an example evaluation that uses toy data from the package: 

$~$

``` {r quantile-example1}
quantile_example <- data.table::setDT(scoringutils::quantile_example_data_long)
print(quantile_example, 3, 3)
```
$~$
``` {r quantile-example2}
eval <- scoringutils::eval_forecasts(quantile_example, 
                                     by = c("model", "id", "horizon"),
                                     summarise_by = c("model", "range"))
print(eval)
```

$~$

The example data has forecasts from two different models for two different forecast horizons (e.g. one and two weeks ahead into future) and thirty days (denoted by the column 'id') as well as the corresponding observed values. The unit of a single observation is therefore `c("model", "id", "horizon")`. With the `summarise_by` argument we can specify that we want to average over horizons and time points and have one average score per model, separated for the different interval ranges. In addition to the mean score, we could have obtained arbitrary quantiles and the standard deviation using the `quantile` arguemnt or the `sd` argument. 

The following metrics are returned: 'interval_score' refers to the Weighted Interval Score , 'sharpness', 'is_underprediction' and 'is_underprediction' are its three components that together sum up to the WIS. 'Calibration' refers to the coverage achieved by the respective interval range. The column 'coverage_deviation' is calculated as empirical coverage - desired interval coverage and denotes the deviation of empirical interval coverage from the nominal interval coverage. In Chapter \@ref(results) we report coverage deviation instead of empirical coverage, as it does not really make sense to average over the empirical coverage for different ranges.

- crps ensemble works surprisingly well
- tendency bias crps and qra is interesting
- One could argue that the comparison of the ensembles is not entirely fair as the COVIDhub-ensemble model is a much larger ensemble with more components. On the other hand we can require that other ensembles at least not perform worse. 

- some riddles can't be answered with the scores: epiforecasts-ensemble1
- this weird perfect correlation

- restriction due to inclusion of the epiforecasts-ensemble1 --> locations and dates
- break up interval score in width part and miss penalty part



- connect bias / coverage deviation more with actually looking at the plots --> when are states hard and easy to forecast? 
- More connection between results and model types: which models perform well / badly?

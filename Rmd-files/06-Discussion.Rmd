# Discussion


- crps ensemble works surprisingly well
- tendency bias crps and qra is interesting
- One could argue that the comparison of the ensembles is not entirely fair as the COVIDhub-ensemble model is a much larger ensemble with more components. On the other hand we can require that other ensembles at least not perform worse. 

- some riddles can't be answered with the scores: epiforecasts-ensemble1
- this weird perfect correlation

- restriction due to inclusion of the epiforecasts-ensemble1 --> locations and dates
- break up interval score in width part and miss penalty part



- connect bias / coverage deviation more with actually looking at the plots --> when are states hard and easy to forecast? 
- More connection between results and model types: which models perform well / badly?







<!-- Procedure:  -->

<!-- 1) get a feeling for the data --> visualisation -->
<!-- 2) get a ranking, e.g. if we wanted to make a quick decision -->
<!--     --> summarised score -->
<!--     --> regression -->

<!-- 3) understand the metrics and what really drives them -->
<!--     --> look at correlation between scores -->
<!--     --> look at contributions from missing / too little sharpness -->
<!--     --> look at contribution from individual ranges -->
<!--     --> correlation between WIS and case numbers / WIS and horizons? -->
<!--     --> contributions from states /  -->

<!-- 4) understand what drives differences in performance  -->
<!--     --> different states: which were the ones that models did badly in?  -->
<!--     --> different horizons? when? interaction with states?  -->

<!-- 5) understand individual models and how to improve them -->
<!--     --> calibration -->
<!--     --> sharpness -->

<!-- summary: do I find characteristics of well / badly performing models?  -->




<!-- Interesting questions -->
<!-- - how do different ranges contribute to scoes -->
<!-- --> if a score is not good, what do we look for?  -->
<!-- which states were hard to forecast and why?  -->
<!-- do models do consistently well or badly?  -->
<!-- What do models get right?  -->
<!-- 	- trend changes -->
<!-- 	- changes in uncertainty?  -->
<!-- Drivers of the WIS -->
<!-- 	correlation metrics -->
<!-- 	scores at different ranges -->
<!-- 	scores at different locations -->

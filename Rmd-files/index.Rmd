``` {r}

library(EpiSoon)

```


Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), 
                   'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 
                   'EpiSoon', 'stackr', 'forecastHybrid'), 
                 'packages.bib')
```

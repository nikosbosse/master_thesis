<!-- # Todo {-} -->
<!-- - bring Appendix in order -->

<!-- - make all plot model colours consistent -->

<!-- - maybe use explicit numbering for the individual sections in the chapter introductions -->

<!-- - figure average wis vs. state: add median with white diamond and mean -->

<!-- - Do I want all equations numbered? -->



<!-- ## Half-solved todos or probably not going to be solved todos -->
<!-- - Explain more how I got to the set of scores I summarise over -->

<!-- - pit plots quantile scoringutils -->

<!-- - Work through all the citations and adapt the author names in the bib file so they get shown consistently -->

<!-- ## To dos for some happy day in the future {-} -->

<!-- - Maybe add the different possible calibration types to the evaluation chapter -->

<!-- - Read more about stacking. Is the QRA stacking?  -->

<!-- - Do I want a summary section for each Chapter?  -->

<!-- - Maybe implement an equally weighted mixture ensemble -->

<!-- - Maybe add a part for Point Forecast Scores in Evaluation Chapter. The Part about when to use MAE and MSE. Also maybe add those to scoringutils -->

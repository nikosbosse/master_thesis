# Todo

- Work through all the citations and adapt the author names in the bib file so they get shown consistently

- update data to include more dates

- Maybe add renewal equation / more detail to Chapter 2 and our epiforecasts-ensemble model

- Think about whether to move the introduction of the covid hub models to Chapter 5 results (current tendency is not to do that) 

- maybe do a quick random effects models on WIS

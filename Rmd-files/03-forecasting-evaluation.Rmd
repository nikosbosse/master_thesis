# Forecasting and evaluation {#evaluation}

Model evaluation is an integral of the forecasting process that can provide valuable insights. Not only can it help the forecaster to choose one or multiple models to make predictions. It also allows to get a better understanding of the models. Learning of systematic shortcomings may provide valuable hints how the models can be improved. We can also easily track the effects of small model changes on overall performance. 

This chapter lays out an evaluation framework that will later be used to evaluate the forecasts submitted to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. The chapter will first give a brief overview of different types of forecasts to provide a theoretical background for the remainder of this chapter. Then, it will introduce the forecasting paradigm as formulated by @gneitingCalibratedProbabilisticForecasting2005 and @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007. The forecasting paradigm focuses on two aspects of forecasts, 'calibration' and 'sharpness'. The chapter will subsequently present different ways of assessing calibration and sharpness, followed by a discussion of proper scoring rules scores that allow us to summarise the quality of a forecast in a single number. It lastly proposes an evaluation algorithm and presents the `scoringuitls` package, an R package designed to evaluate forecasts. 

## Types of forecasts

A forecast is the forecaster’s stated belief about the future. This belief can be stated in a variety of ways with differing degrees of complexity. The simplest way to state our belief about the future is a point forecast, for example “the number of deaths from Covid-19 cases in the US in December 2020 will be 20 000”. This is, in essence, an estimate of the mean of the unknown true data-generating distribution of deaths from Covid-19 in the US in December 2020. We could go one step further and also try and quantify our uncertainty by stating a variance or standard deviation. This could be understood as a point forecast for the variance of the distribution - or it could be understood as a first step towards a probabilistic forecast.

Ideally, predictions should be stated in terms of predictive distributions. This allows us to state our beliefs about all aspects of the underlying data-generating distribution (including e.g. skewness or the width of its tails) and helps us to accurately quantify our uncertainty. We could for example make a forecast stating that “the number of cases in December 2020 follows a (discretised) normal distribution with a mean of 25 000 and a variance of 2,000”. Such a forecast is called a probabilistic forecast. This thesis focuses mainly on probabilistic forecasts. The predictive distribution can be expressed analytically, but instead it will often be represented by a set of predictive samples from that distribution. This is especially handy as we can use algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to generate predictions if no analytical expression of the predictive distribution is available. The downside is that predictive samples take a lot of storage space. They also come with a loss of precision that is especially pronounced in the tails of the predictive distribution, where we need quite a lot of samples to characterise the distribution accurately. 

To circumvent these problems, often quantiles of the predictive distribution are stored instead. Quantile forecasts can easily be obtained from explicit distributional forecasts as well as from predictive samples. 

Note that we could also in principle state our forecasts in a binary way. We could for example ask: "Will the number of Covid-19 related deaths in December 2020 exceed 25 000?" and give a probability that this will happen. This type of forecasting is common in many classification problems, but will not be the focus of this thesis. 

All of these forecast types require slightly different approaches to evaluation. The following section will introduce the general forecasting paradigm proposed by Gneiting et al., and the remainder of this chapter will derive a consistent evaluation framework based on it. 

## What is a good forecast? - The forecasting paradigm

Ideally, the predictive distribution is equal to the true data-generating distribution (see @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007), i.e.
$$ P_t = F_t $$
where $P_t$ is the the cumulative density function (CDF) of the predictive distribution for a given quantity at time $t$ and $F_t$ is the CDF of the true, unknown data-generating distribution. In practice, the true data-generating distribution $F_t$ is unknown. Following @gneitingCalibratedProbabilisticForecasting2005 and @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007 we can instead focus our efforts on two aspects of the predictive distribution *calibration* and *sharpness*. Calibration refers to the statistical consistency between the predictive distribution and the observation. There are different possible ways in which a model can be (mis-)calibrated (see @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007 for details), but for the remainder of this thesis it suffices to say that a well calibrated forecast does not systematically deviate from the observed values. Sharpness is a feature of the forecast only and describes how concentrated the predictive distribution is, i.e. how precise the forecasts are. The general forecasting paradigm states that we should *maximise sharpness of the predictive distribution subject to calibration*. To summarise these concepts in more familiar terms: we can think of calibration as "how correct is this forecast?" and of sharpness as "how useful would this forecast be if it were true". Take, fore example, the task of predicting rain in a city like London. A model that predicted a rain probability of 20% for every single day could be called correct (to be precise, this model would be marginally calibrated according to @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007). This model, however, would be much less useful than a model that would be able to accurately predict the weather every day. 

The following sections will look at calibration and sharpness in more detail. They will first discuss different ways to assess these two properties independently. This can give the forecaster a better understanding of how their forecasts could be improved. Then, proper scoring rules will be introduced that allow us to represent the quality of a forecast in one numeric value. 


## Assesssing calibration 

In absence of knowledge of the true data-generating distribution we cannot prove calibration, but only look for absence of miscalibration. Several strategies have been proposed to detect systematic deviations of the predictive distributions from the observations (see e.g. @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019; @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007). In order to get a clearer picture of the different ways in which a model can be miscalibrated, it makes sense to look at calibration from more than one angle. We will discuss a bias metric as well as the probability integral transformation (PIT) for integer and continuous forecasts and separate bias and calibration metrics for quantile forecasts. 

### Assessing bias

Systematic over- or underprediction is a very common form of miscalibration. It therefore makes sense to dedicate separate attention to detecting systematic biases. Assessing whether a predictive distribution has a tendency to over- or underpredict can be very easily achieved by simply evaluating the predictive distribution at the true observed value. DO WE HAVE A CITATION FOR THIS? To improve the interpretability of the score we can transform it to a value between -1 (under-prediction) and 1 (over-prediction). Bias is then measured as 

$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - 2 \cdot (P_t (x_t))$$
where $P_t$ is the cumulative distribution function of the predictive distribution for the true value $x_t$. When using predictive samples, $P_t (x_t)$ is simply the fraction of predictive samples for $x_t$ that are smaller than the true observed $x_t$.

For integer valued forecasts, [@funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019] adapt this formula slightly and propose the following metric: 
$$B_t (P_t, x_t) = 1 - (P_t (x_t) + P_t (x_t + 1))$$
to adjust for the integer nature of the forecasts. Bias can then again assume values between -1 (under-prediction) and 1 (over-prediction) and is 0 ideally. 

DO I WANT A SUBHEADING HERE?

For quantile forecasts, we propose the following metric to assess bias: 
\begin{align*}
  B_t &= (1 - 2 \cdot \max \{i | q_{t,i} \in Q_t \land q_{t,i} \leq x_t\}) \mathbb{1}( x_t \leq q_{t, 0.5}) \\
  &+ (1 - 2 \cdot \min \{i | q_{t,i} \in Q_t \land q_{t,i} \geq x_t\}) \mathbb{1}( x_t \geq q_{t, 0.5})
\end{align*}, 

where $Q_t$ is the set of quantiles that form the predictive distribution at time $t$. They represent our belief about what the true value $x_t$ will be. For consistency, we define $Q_t$ such that it always includes the element $q_{t, 0} = - \infty$ and $q_{t,1} = \infty$. $\mathbb{1}()$ is the indicator function that is $1$ if the condition is satisfied and $0$ otherwise. In clearer terms, $B_t$ is defined as the maximum percentile rank for which the corresponding quantile is still below the true value, if the true value is smaller than the median of the predictive distribution. If the true value is above the median of the predictive distribution, then $B_t$ is the minimum percentile rank for which the corresponding quantile is still larger than the true value. If the true value is exactly the median, both terms cancel out and $B_t$ is zero. For a large enough number of quantiles, the percentile rank will equal the proportion of predictive samples below the observed true value, and this metric coincides with the one for continuous forecasts. Figure \ref{fig:bias-example} shows the bias for one week ahead predictions made by the COVIDhub-baseline model. 

``` {r bias-example, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "One week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model for the US (top) and corresponding bias values (bottom)"}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/bias_example.png")

```


### The probability integral transform

As explained above, for a model with perfect calibration the CDF of predictice distribution $P_t$ will be identical to the CDF of the true data-generating distribution $G_t$ that generated the observed value $x_t$. To assess whether that is the case, @dawidPresentPositionPotential1984 suggested to check whether the probability integral transform (PIT) of the predictive distribution follows a uniform distribution. The PIT is given by 

$$u_t = P_t (x_t)$$
where $u_t$ is the transformed variable and $P_t(x_t)$ is the predictive distribution evaluated at the true observed value $x_t$. If $P_t = F_t$ at all times $t$, then $u_t, t = 1 \dots T$ will be uniformly distributed (For a proof see e.g. @angusProbabilityIntegralTransform1994). One can plot a histogram of $u_t$ values to look for deviations from uniformity. U-shaped histograms often result from predictions that are too narrow, while hump-shaped histograms indicate that predictions may be too wide. Biased predictions will usually result in a triangle-shaped histogram. Figure \@ref(fig:pit-examples) shows different simulated example PIT histograms that illustrate these characteristics. 

In addition to the visual inspection, we can apply an Anderson-Darling [@andersonAsymptoticTheoryCertain1952] test for uniformity to the transformed values. The results, however, have to be treated with caution. The test cannot prove uniformity, but only assess whether there is evidence against it. It is also quite sensitive to the number of $u_t$ samples available and may be overly conservative in rejecting calibration. As a rule of thumb, Funk et al. suggest there is no evidence to suggest a forecasting model is miscalibrated if the p-value found was greater than a threshold of $p \geq 0.1$, some evidence that it was miscalibrated if $0.01 < p < 0.1$, and good evidence that it was miscalibrated if $p \leq 0.01$. If we look at Figure \@ref(fig:pit-examples) again, we can see that uniformity is rejected, even though the predictive distribution is identical to the data-generating distribution CHECK THAT IS ACTUALLY THE CASE - IT DEPENDS FROM RUN TO RUN. It therefore seems sensible not to rely too heavily on the Anderson-Darling test. 

``` {r pit-examples, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.asp = 0.7, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Examples of different predictive distributions for the same set of true standard normally distributed observed values and the corresponding PIT histogram below. Top left: predictive distribution and distribution of the true values coincide. Top right: The mean of the preditive distribution is higher than of the true data-generating distibution. Bottom left: the predictive distribution is underdispersed and exhibits to little uncertainty. Bottom right: the predictive distribution is overdispersed and too uncertain."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/calibration-examples.png")

```

@hamillInterpretationRankHistograms2001 discusses in length that uniformity of the PIT histogram is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for calibration. Nevertheless, the PIT histogram can give us a good impression of the reliability of our forecasts. Figure \@ref(fig:pit-baseline-model) shows the pit histogram for one week ahead predictions made by the COVIDhub-baseline model over different states. In order to obtain samples, a separate gamma distribution was first fit to every set of quantiles using the `nloptr` package [@R-nloptr]. Samples were then drawn from these distributions. We can see that the PIT histogram presents a pattern that suggests under-dispersion may be present, i.e. at least some of the confidence intervals may be too narrow. 

``` {r pit-baseline-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "PIT histogram for one week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model. We can see a pattern commonly found in underdispersed predictions"}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/pit-baseline-model.png")

```

In the case of discrete outcomes, the PIT is no longer uniform even when forecasts are ideal. We can follow [@funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019] and use a randomised PIT instead by redefining 

$$u_t = P_t(x_t) + v \cdot (P_t(x_t) - P_t(x_t - 1) )$$
where $x_t$ is the observed value at time $t$ and $P_t()$ is the cumulative predictive distribution function and $P_t (-1) = 0$ by definition. $v$ is a standard uniform variable and independent of $x$. If $P_t$ is equal to the true data-generating distribution function, then $u_t$ is standard uniform. [@czadoPredictiveModelAssessment2009] also propose a non-randomised version of the PIT for count data that could be used alternatively. 

### Calibration and empirical coverage

Another way to look at calibration (precisely: probabilistic calibration in @gneitingProbabilisticForecastsCalibration2007)
can be examined by comparing empirical coverage of observed values with the nominal coverage implied by the CDF of the predictive distribution. This is most easily understood in the context of quantile forecasts, but can in principle be transferred to continuous and integer forecasts as well. 

To assess coverage at a certain interval range, we simply measure the proportion of true observed values that fall into that range of the predictive distribution. If the 0.05, 0.25, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles are given, then 50% of the true values should fall between the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles and 90% should fall between the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles. We can calculate and plot these values to inspect how well different interval ranges of the forecast are calibrated. This is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:interval-coverage) where the empirical coverage of the US forecasts of the COVIDhub-baseline model is shown. We can seen that the interval coverage for the outer prediction intervals looks reasonable, but inner prediction intervals seem too narrow in some way. If we compare this to Figure \@ref(fig:pit-baseline-model), we can see a similar pattern that suggests underdispersion of the predictive distribution in both Figures. Compared to the PIT histogram, the coverage plot is able to narrow the problem down to the inner prediction intervals. 

``` {r interval-coverage, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "Coverage of predictive intervals for one week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/interval-coverage.png")

```

To get an even more precise picture, we can also look at the percentage of true values below every single quantile of the predictive distribution. The quantile visualisation shown in Figure \ref(fig:quantile-coverage) suggests that the miscalibration largely comes from an upward bias of the inner prediction interval (compare to Figure \@ref(fig:example-bias)). The major problem to address then, it seems, is not necessarily the general width of the prediction intervals, but foremost the upward bias of the inner quantiles. Note that this is a slightly different result from what Figures \@ref(fig:interval-coverage) and \@ref(fig:pit-baseline-model) suggested which underlines the importance of looking at miscalibration from various angles. 

``` {r quantile-coverage, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "Coverage of predictive quantiles for one week ahead forecasts from the COVIDhub-baseline model."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/quantile-coverage.png")

```


## Assessing sharpness

Sharpness, i.e. the ability to produce narrow forecasts, is a quality of the forecasts only and does not depend on the observations. Sharpness is therefore only of interest conditional on calibration. 

For continuous and integer forecasts, @funkAssessingPerformanceRealtime2019 suggest to measure sharpness as the normalised median absolute deviation about the median (MADN), i.e.

$$ S_t(P_t) = \frac{1}{0.675} \cdot \text{median}(|y - \text{median(y)}|) $$, 

where $\frac{1}{0.675}$ is a normalising constant that ensures that sharpness will equal the standard distribution if $P_t$ is normal and $y$ is the vector of all predictive samples. 

For quantile forecasts, we propose to measure sharpness as a weighted sum of the width of the interval ranges. Let $Q_t$ be a set of predicted quantiles for a true $x_t$ at time $t$. This set of quantiles is assumed to be symmetric, such that there always exist corresponding elements $q_{t, \frac{\alpha}{2}}$ and $q_{t, 1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$. These corresponding pairs of quantiles cover a $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100$ interval range. Sharpness of a quantile forecast at time $t$ can then be measured as

$$\text{sharpness}_t = \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\alpha}{2} (q_{t, 1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}} - q_{t, \frac{\alpha}{2}}) $$.
THINK ABOUT THIS SCORE





## Proper scoring rules

Instead of assessing calibration and sharpness independently, we can make use of proper scoring rules to express the quality of our forecast in a single number. Propriety is a feature of a score that guarantees that the ideal forecast will always receive the lowest score [@gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007]. A forecaster judged by a proper scoring rule is therefore always incentivised to make forecasts as close to the true data-generating distribution as possible. In the following, three proper scoring rules will be presented. 

MAYBE EXPLANATION OF SEPARATION OF PROPER SCORING RULES INTO CALIBRATION AND SHARPNESS PART? HANS HERSBACH? 

### Log Score

The Log score can be traced back to @shannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948 and his work on communication and information theory and to @goodRationalDecisions1952 who first proposed a log score for binary predictions. The Log Score is now widely used in all sorts of fields, especially in Bayesian inference (see e.g. [@gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014]). The log score is simply the log density of the predictive distribution at time $t$ evaluated at the true observed value, i.e. 

$$ \text{log score}_t = \log p_t(x_t)$$
where $p_t$ is the predictive density function at time $t$. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:log-score}. In this formulation, larger values are better, but one can of course simply reverse the sign. One problem with the log score is that it can be quite unstable for values of $p_t(x_t)$ close to zero. The log score will therefore not play a large role in this thesis, but is mentioned for completeness sake. 

``` {r log-score, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "Illustration of the Log score as the log predictive desnity evaluated at the true observed value"}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/log-score-example.png")

```


### (Continuous) Ranked Probability Score

The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) [@mathesonScoringRulesContinuous1976; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007] is considered more stable and therefore better suited for our purposes. The CRPS is defined as 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:crps)
\text{CRPS}(P_t, x_t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( P(y) - \mathbb(1)(y \geq x_t) \right)^2 dy,
\end{equation}

where $P_t$ is again the CDF of the predictive distribution and $x_t$ is the true observed value. 

The CRPS can also be expressed as 

$$ \text{CRPS}(P_t, x_t) = \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{P_t} |X - X'| - \mathbb{E}_P |X - x_t| $$,

where $X$ and $X'$ are independent realisations from the predictive distributions $P_t$ with finite first moment (@gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007). This formulation is convenient as we can simply replace $X$ and $X'$ with predictive samples and sum over all possible combinations to obtain the desired sample CRPS. 

For integer counts, we can use the Ranked Probability Score (RPS) as proposed by @epsteinScoringSystemProbability1969 and  @murphyRankedProbabilityScore1969, and discussed e.g. by @czadoPredictiveModelAssessment2009. The RPS is defined as 

$$ \text{rps}(P_t, x_t) = \sum_{y = 0}^\infty (P_t(y) - \mathbb(1) (y \geq x_t))^2 $$

Smaller values of the (C)RPS are preferable. For the case of a point prediction, the predictive distribution degenerates to a distribution with its entire masss on the single predicted point. In this case, the CRPS is equivalent to the mean absolute error (MAE) of the point prediction. If we consider Equation \@ref(eq:crps) for a step function, then the crps will equal the area between the true observed value and the predicted value (as $1^2 = 1$ and the height of the rectangle is again 1).
This is illustrated in the top half of Figure \@ref(fig:crps-explanation). For other distributions this will not hold, as $P_t()$ is in Equation \@ref(eq:crps). Intuitively, we can nevertheless understand the CRPS as measuring the vertical distance between the predictive CDF and the true value as illustrated in the bottom half of Figure \@ref(crps_explanation), 

``` {r crps-explanation, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.cap = "Illustration of the CRPS. Top: CRPS for a predictive distribution with point mass on the predicted value, $1$. The CRPS corresponds to the mean absolute error of the point prediction, i.e. the absolute difference between the predicted value 1 and the true observed value 0. Bottom: Intuitive llustration of the CRPS as the vertical distance between the CDF and the true value. Note that the CRPS does not in fact equal the shaded area, as the term in @\ref(eq:crps) is squared."}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-3-evaluation/log-score-example.png")

```




### Interval score

The Interval Score is a proper scoring rule to evaluate predictions in a quantile format [@bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2020; @gneitingStrictlyProperScoring2007]. Smaller values are better. Let us consider a pair of predictive quantiles $q_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}, q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ that form a $(1 - \alpha) * 100$ prediction interval. Let us denote $q_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, the lower bound, as $l$, and $q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$, the upper bound, as $u$. Then the Interval score is given as 

$$\text{IS}_{\alpha} = (u - l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l - x) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \leq l) 
+ \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (x - u) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \geq u)$$

This score can be separated into three parts: $(u - l)$ measures the sharpness of the predictive distribution. $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l - x) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \leq l)$ and $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (x - u) \cdot \mathbb{1}(x \geq u)$ are penalties that occur if the observed value falls below the lower or above the upper end of the interval range. 

Usually, more than one predictive interval is reported at once. We can obtain the overall interval score as a (weighted) sum of individual interval score contributions:

$$ \text{IS} = \sum_\alpha w_\alpha \cdot \text{IS}_\alpha$$. 

This interval score is proper for any non-negative choice of $w_\alpha$. For $w_\alpha = \frac{\alpha}{2}$, one can show that the interval score converges to the CRPS for an increasing set of equally spaced prediction intervals [@bracherEvaluatingEpidemicForecasts2020] MAYBE MORE REFERENCES FROM THE PAPER. We shall call the so weighted score the weighted interval score (WIS). 

PART THAT WIS FOR ALPHA = 0 IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE MAE

<!-- ### Scoring point forecasts -->

## A proposed evaluation framework

The previous sections have introduced a variety of different metrics that serve to highlight different aspects of model performance. Taking all of these together I propose the following evaluation algorithm: 

REWORK THIS 

1. Look at the data and the actual predictions made to get a feeling for the individual models
2. Look at the summarised scores from the proper scoring rules and other metrics to obtain a rough ranking of the different models. Note that different proper scoring rules treat deviations from the optimal forecast differently and may therefore give different model rankings. They are therefore very valuable as an overall performance summary (and for model aggregation as described in Chapter \@ref(model-aggregation)), but cannot replace a thorough model assessment. 
3. Examine plots for the different aspects of calibration described earlier. These include bias, the PIT histogram and plots of interval and quantile coverage. 
4. Look at sharpness
5. Use a regression framework to determine differences between the models and other random effects. THIS PART IS NOT YET INCLUDED IN THE THESIS. 

This evaluation algorithm will be applied to the Forecast Hub and ensemble models in Chapter \@ref(results). 

## The scoringutils package

The methods described in this chapter were bundled in the R package `scoringutils` [@R-scoringutils]. The stable (but now outdated) version of the package is available on CRAN, the development version can be found on github. Internally, `scoringutils` uses `data.table` to allow for an efficient handling of large data.frames. The package is extensively documented, has example data and a vignette that walks the user through all relevant steps. 

Evaluation metrics in the package can be accessed in two different ways.  They can either be used independently from each other in a format built around vectors and matrices. Alternatively, users can decide to have forecasts automatically scored in a `data.frame` format through the function `eval_forecast`. 

`eval_forecast` takes in a `data.frame` with predictions and true observed values. Users then specify the unit of a single observation with the `by` argument that takes in a character vector with different column names. If predictions are for example made at different forecast dates by several models in several locations over different horizons, then the user should specify `by = c("model", "forecast_date", "location", "horizon")`. Scores can be aggregated over different groups using `summarise_by`. If we are only interested in the score per model, we would specify `summarise_by = c("model")`. The `quantiles` argument allows us to summarise the aggregated scores by a set of quantiles. This is especially useful for plotting. 

The following snippet shows an example evaluation that uses toy data from the package: 

``` {r quantile-example1}
quantile_example <- data.table::setDT(scoringutils::quantile_example_data_long)
print(quantile_example, 3, 3)
```

``` {r quantile-example2}
eval <- scoringutils::eval_forecasts(quantile_example, 
                                     by = c("model", "id", "horizon"), 
                                     quantiles = c(0.5),
                                     summarise_by = c("model", "range"))
print(eval)
```

'Calibration', in the context of this `eval_forecasts` output refers to the coverage achieved by the respective interval range. The column 'coverage_deviation' denotes the deviation of empirical interval coverage from the desired interval coverage. This is reported instead of empirical coverage, as it does not really make sense to average over the empirical coverage. 






MAYBE A DISCUSSION: FORGET CALIBRATION, WE CARE ABOUT ACCURACY?

# Results - evaluation and aggregation of Covid-19 death forecasts {#results}

SOMEWHERE: NUMBER OF STATES, OBSERVATIONS, MODELS ETC


``` {r models-us, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "One week ahead forecasts for the US from all models"}

knitr::include_graphics("../visualisation/chapter-5-results/US-forecast-1-wk-ahead.png")

```

More plots --> Appendix

Plots: 
- overall performance
- performance in different states
- performance over horizons




Which states were easy to forecast? Which ones were hard to forecast? 

Which model perform well and why?

Which ensembling approaches perform well? 




## Discussion 

- would be good to have a plot / some analysis on how good the gamma fit for the CRPS actually works

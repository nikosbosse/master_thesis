Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

	abstract = {Background
Cardiomyocytes are rich in mitochondria which are situated in spatially-distinct subcellular regions including those under the plasma membrane, subsarcolemmal mitochondria; and those between the myofibrils, interfibrillar mitochondria. We previously observed subpopulation-specific differences in mitochondrial proteomes following diabetic insult. The objective of this study was to determine whether mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins are regulated by microRNAs inside the mitochondrion and whether subcellular spatial location or diabetes mellitus influences the dynamics.

Methods and Results
Using microarray technology coupled with cross-linking immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing, we identified a pool of mitochondrial microRNAs, termed mitomiRs that are redistributed in spatially-distinct mitochondrial subpopulations in an inverse manner following diabetic insult. Redistributed mitomiRs displayed distinct interactions with the mitochondrial genome requiring specific stoichiometric associations with RISC constituents argonaute-2 (Ago2) and fragile X mental retardation–related protein 1 (FXR1) for translational regulation. In the presence of Ago2 and FXR1, redistribution of mitomiR-378 to the IFM following diabetic insult led to down regulation of mitochondrially-encoded F0 component ATP6. Next generation sequencing analyses identified specific transcriptome and mitomiR sequences associated with ATP6 regulation. Overexpression of mitomiR-378 in HL-1 cells resulted in its accumulation in the mitochondrion and down-regulation of functional ATP6 protein, while antagomir blockade restored functional ATP6 protein and cardiac pump function.

Conclusions
We propose mitomiRs can translationally regulate mitochondrially-encoded proteins in spatially-distinct mitochondrial subpopulations during diabetes mellitus. The results reveal the requirement of RISC constituents in the mitochondrion for functional mitomiR translational regulation and provide a connecting link between diabetic insult and ATP synthase function.},

	abstract = {Rationale
MicroRNAs (miRs) are expanding our understanding of cardiac disease and have the potential to transform cardiovascular therapeutics. One miR can target hundreds of individual mRNAs, but existing methodologies are not sufficient to accurately and comprehensively identify these mRNA targets in vivo.

Objective
To develop methods permitting identification of in vivo miR targets in an unbiased manner, using massively parallel sequencing of mouse cardiac transcriptomes in combination with sequencing of mRNA associated with mouse cardiac RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs).

Methods and Results
We optimized techniques for expression profiling small amounts of RNA without introducing amplification bias, and applied this to anti-Argonaute 2 immunoprecipitated RISCs (RISC-Seq) from mouse hearts. By comparing RNA-sequencing results of cardiac RISC and transcriptome from the same individual hearts, we defined 1,645 mRNAs consistently targeted to mouse cardiac RISCs. We employed this approach in hearts overexpressing miRs from Myh6 promoter-driven precursors (programmed RISC-Seq) to identify 209 in vivo targets of miR-133a and 81 in vivo targets of miR-499. Consistent with the fact that miR-133a and miR-499 have widely differing ‘seed’ sequences and belong to different miR families, only 6 targets were common to miR-133a- and miR-499-programmed hearts.

Conclusions
RISC-sequencing is a highly sensitive method for general RISC profiling and individual miR target identification in biological context, and is applicable to any tissue and any disease state.

Summary
MicroRNAs (miRs) are key regulators of mRNA translation in health and disease. While bioinformatic predictions suggest that a single miR may target hundreds of mRNAs, the number of experimentally verified targets of miRs is low. To enable comprehensive, unbiased examination of miR targets, we have performed deep RNA sequencing of cardiac transcriptomes in parallel with cardiac RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-associated RNAs (the RISCome), called RISC sequencing. We developed methods that did not require cross-linking of RNAs to RISCs or amplification of mRNA prior to sequencing, making it possible to rapidly perform RISC sequencing from intact tissue while avoiding amplification bias. Comparison of RISCome with transcriptome expression defined the degree of RISC enrichment for each mRNA. The majority of the mRNAs enriched in wild-type cardiac RISComes compared to transcriptomes were bioinformatically predicted to be targets of at least 1 of 139 cardiac-expressed miRs. Programming cardiomyocyte RISCs via transgenic overexpression in adult hearts of miR-133a or miR-499, two miRs that contain entirely different ‘seed’ sequences, elicited differing profiles of RISC-targeted mRNAs. Thus, RISC sequencing represents a highly sensitive method for general RISC profiling and individual miR target identification in biological context.},

	abstract = {Motivation:
N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA methylation but precise prediction of its mRNA location is important for understanding its function. A recent sequencing technology, known as Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing technology (MeRIP-seq), has been developed for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A. We previously developed a peak calling algorithm called exomePeak. However, exomePeak over-simplifies data characteristics and ignores the reads’ variances among replicates or reads dependency across a site region. To further improve the performance, new model is needed to address these important issues of MeRIP-seq data., Results: We propose a novel, graphical model-based peak calling method, MeTPeak, for transcriptome-wide detection of m6A sites from MeRIP-seq data. MeTPeak explicitly models read count of an m6A site and introduces a hierarchical layer of Beta variables to capture the variances and a Hidden Markov model to characterize the reads dependency across a site. In addition, we developed a constrained Newton’s method and designed a log-barrier function to compute analytically intractable, positively constrained Beta parameters. We applied our algorithm to simulated and real biological datasets and demonstrated significant improvement in detection performance and robustness over exomePeak. Prediction results on publicly available MeRIP-seq datasets are also validated and shown to be able to recapitulate the known patterns of m6A, further validating the improved performance of MeTPeak., Availability and implementation: The package ‘MeTPeak’ is implemented in R and C ++, and additional details are available at https://github.com/compgenomics/MeTPeak, Contact:

Furthermore, the molecular pathways that control gene expression are often the target of cellular parasites, such as viruses. Gene expression is controlled through multiple mechanisms that are coordinated to ensure the proper and timely expression of each gene. Many of these mechanisms target the life cycle of the RNA molecule, from transcription to translation. Recently, another layer of regulation at the RNA level involving RNA modifications has gained renewed interest of the scientific community. The discovery that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a modification present in mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs, can be removed by the activity of RNA demethylases, launched the field of epitranscriptomics; the study of how RNA function is regulated through the addition or removal of post-transcriptional modifications, similar to strategies used to regulate gene expression at the DNA and protein level. The abundance of RNA post-transcriptional modifications is determined by the activity of writer complexes (methylase) and eraser (RNA demethylase) proteins. Subsequently, the effects of RNA modifications materialize as changes in RNA structure and/or modulation of interactions between the modified RNA and RNA binding proteins or regulatory RNAs. Disruption of these pathways impairs gene expression and cellular function. This review focuses on the links between the RNA modification m6A and its implications in human diseases.},

6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a reversible modification in mRNA and has been shown to regulate processing, translation and decay of mRNA. However, the roles of m6A modification in neuronal development are still not known. Here, we found that the m6A eraser FTO is enriched in axons and can be locally translated. Axon-specific inhibition of FTO by rhein, or compartmentalized siRNA knockdown of Fto in axons led to increases of m6A levels. GAP-43 mRNA is modified by m6A and is a substrate of FTO in axons. Loss-of-function of this non-nuclear pool of FTO resulted in increased m6A modification and decreased local translation of axonal GAP-43 mRNA, which eventually repressed axon elongation. Mutation of a predicted m6A site in GAP-43 mRNA eliminated its m6A modification and exempted regulation of its local translation by axonal FTO. This work showed an example of dynamic internal m6A demethylation of non-nuclear localized mRNA by the demethylase FTO. Regulation of m6A modification of axonal mRNA by axonal FTO might be a general mechanism to control their local translation in neuronal development.},

	abstract = {The first step in the biogenesis of microRNAs is the processing of primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by the microprocessor complex, composed of the RNA binding protein DGCR8 and the ribonuclease type III DROSHA–. This initial event requires the recognition of the junction between the stem and the flanking single-stranded RNA of the pri-miRNA hairpin by DGCR8 followed by recruitment of DROSHA, which cleaves the RNA duplex to yield the pre-miRNA product. While the mechanisms underlying pri-miRNA processing have been elucidated, the mechanism by which DGCR8 recognizes and binds pri-miRNAs as opposed to other secondary structures present in transcripts is not understood. We find that methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) methylates pri-miRNAs, marking them for recognition and processing by DGCR8. Consistent with this, METTL3 depletion reduced the binding of DGCR8 to pri-miRNAs and resulted in the global reduction of mature miRNAs and concomitant accumulation of unprocessed pri-miRNAs. In vitro processing reactions confirmed the sufficiency of the m6A mark in promoting pri-miRNA processing. Finally, gain-of-function experiments revealed that METTL3 is sufficient to enhance miRNA maturation in a global and non-cell-type specific manner. Our findings reveal that the m6A mark acts as a key post-transcriptional modification that promotes the initiation of miRNA biogenesis.},

	abstract = {An extensive repertoire of modifications is known to underlie the versatile coding, structural and catalytic functions of RNA, but it remains largely uncharted territory. Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing has become an important technology for studying expression levels in many types of genomic, and particularly transcriptomic, data. One key way of analysing such data is to look for elements of the data which display particular patterns of differential expression in order to take these forward for further analysis and validation.
RESULTS: We propose a framework for defining patterns of differential expression and develop a novel algorithm, baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples. The method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data and derives an empirically determined prior distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the performance of the method on real and simulated data.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method performs at least as well, and often better, than existing methods for analyses of pairwise differential expression in both real and simulated data. When we compare methods for the analysis of data from experimental designs involving multiple sample groups, our method again shows substantial gains in performance. We believe that this approach thus represents an important step forward for the analysis of count data from sequencing experiments.},

Rapidly changing technologies and application mean that novel methods for detecting differential behaviour that account for a 'large P, small n' setting are required at an increasing rate. The development of such methods is, in general, being done on an ad hoc basis, requiring further development cycles and a lack of standardization between analyses.
RESULTS: We present here a generalized method for identifying differential behaviour within high-throughput biological data through empirical Bayesian methods. This approach is based on our baySeq algorithm for identification of differential expression in RNA-seq data based on a negative binomial distribution, and in paired data based on a beta-binomial distribution. Here we show how the same empirical Bayesian approach can be applied to any parametric distribution, removing the need for lengthy development of novel methods for differently distributed data. Comparisons with existing methods developed to address specific problems in high-throughput biological data show that these generic methods can achieve equivalent or better performance. A number of enhancements to the basic algorithm are also presented to increase flexibility and reduce computational costs.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods are implemented in the R baySeq (v2) package, available on Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/baySeq.html.

Methods for analysing high-throughput sequencing data from such experiments are required to identify differential expression, both within paired samples and between pairs under different experimental conditions.
RESULTS: We develop an empirical Bayesian method based on the beta-binomial distribution to model paired data from high-throughput sequencing experiments. We examine the performance of this method on simulated and real data in a variety of scenarios. Our methods are implemented as part of the RbaySeq package (versions 1.11.6 and greater) available from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).
CONCLUSIONS: We compare our approach to alternatives based on generalised linear modelling approaches and show that our method offers significant gains in performance on simulated data. In testing on real data from oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, we discover greater enrichment of previously identified head and neck squamous cell carcinoma associated gene sets than has previously been achieved through a generalised linear modelling approach, suggesting that similar gains in performance may be found in real data. Our methods thus show real and substantial improvements in analyses of high-throughput sequencing data from paired samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful tool for genome-wide expression profiling of biological samples with the advantage of high-throughput and high resolution. There are many existing algorithms nowadays for quantifying expression levels and detecting differential gene expression, but none of them takes the misaligned reads that are mapped to non-exonic regions into account. We developed a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was established based on the assumption that observed signals are the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution. Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data, true expression signals, assuming governed by the negative binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the accurate detection of differential expressed genes.
RESULTS: We implemented our novel XBSeq algorithm and evaluated it by using a set of simulated expression datasets under different conditions, using a combination of negative binomial and Poisson distributions with parameters derived from real RNA-seq data. We compared the performance of our method with other commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms. We also evaluated the changes in true and false positive rates with variations in biological replicates, differential fold changes, and expression levels in non-exonic regions. We also tested the algorithm on a set of real RNA-seq data where the common and different detection results from different algorithms were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we proposed a novel XBSeq, a differential expression analysis algorithm for RNA-seq data that takes non-exonic mapped reads into consideration. When background noise is at baseline level, the performance of XBSeq and DESeq are mostly equivalent. However, our method surpasses DESeq and other algorithms with the increase of non-exonic mapped reads. Only in very low read count condition XBSeq had a slightly higher false discovery rate, which may be improved by adjusting the background noise effect in this situation. Taken together, by considering non-exonic mapped reads, XBSeq can provide accurate expression measurement and thus detect differential expressed genes even in noisy conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful approach for the detection of differential gene expression with both high-throughput and high resolution capabilities possible depending upon the experimental design chosen. Multiplex experimental designs are now readily available, these can be utilised to increase the numbers of samples or replicates profiled at the cost of decreased sequencing depth generated per sample. These strategies impact on the power of the approach to accurately identify differential expression. This study presents a detailed analysis of the power to detect differential expression in a range of scenarios including simulated null and differential expression distributions with varying numbers of biological or technical replicates, sequencing depths and analysis methods.
RESULTS: Differential and non-differential expression datasets were simulated using a combination of negative binomial and exponential distributions derived from real RNA-Seq data. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms and to quantify the changes in power with respect to true and false positive rates when simulating variations in sequencing depth, biological replication and multiplex experimental design choices.
CONCLUSIONS: This work quantitatively explores comparisons between contemporary analysis tools and experimental design choices for the detection of differential expression using RNA-Seq. We found that the DESeq algorithm performs more conservatively than edgeR and NBPSeq. With regard to testing of various experimental designs, this work strongly suggests that greater power is gained through the use of biological replicates relative to library (technical) replicates and sequencing depth. Strikingly, sequencing depth could be reduced as low as 15\% without substantial impacts on false positive or true positive rates.},

	abstract = {Cytosine methylation is an important DNA epigenetic modification. In vertebrates, methylation occurs at CpG sites, which are dinucleotides where a cytosine is immediately followed by a guanine in the DNA sequence from 5' to 3'. When located in the promoter region of a gene, DNA methylation is often associated with transcriptional silencing of the gene. Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with the development of various diseases such as cancer. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is the current "gold-standard" technology for high-resolution profiling of DNA methylation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is an efficient form of BS-seq that targets CpG-rich DNA regions in order to save sequencing costs. A typical bioinformatics aim is to identify CpGs that are differentially methylated (DM) between experimental conditions. This workflow demonstrates that differential methylation analysis of RRBS data can be conducted using software and methodology originally developed for RNA-seq data. The RNA-seq pipeline is adapted to methylation by adding extra columns to the design matrix to account for read coverage at each CpG, after which the RRBS and RNA-seq pipelines are almost identical. This approach is statistically natural and gives analysts access to a rich collection of analysis tools including generalized linear models, gene set testing and pathway analysis. The article presents a complete start to finish case study analysis of RRBS profiles of different cell populations from the mouse mammary gland using the Bioconductor package edgeR. We show that lineage-committed cells are typically hyper-methylated compared to progenitor cells and this is true on all the autosomes but not the sex chromosomes. We demonstrate a strong negative correlation between methylation of promoter regions and gene expression as measured by RNA-seq for the same cell types, showing that methylation is a regulatory mechanism involved in epithelial linear commitment.},

Although all eQTL studies so far have assayed messenger RNA levels using expression microarrays, recent advances in RNA sequencing enable the analysis of transcript variation at unprecedented resolution. We sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals that have been extensively genotyped by the International HapMap Project. By pooling data from all individuals, we generated a map of the transcriptional landscape of these cells, identifying extensive use of unannotated untranslated regions and more than 100 new putative protein-coding exons. Using the genotypes from the HapMap project, we identified more than a thousand genes at which genetic variation influences overall expression levels or splicing. We demonstrate that eQTLs near genes generally act by a mechanism involving allele-specific expression, and that variation that influences the inclusion of an exon is enriched within and near the consensus splice sites. Our results illustrate the power of high-throughput sequencing for the joint analysis of variation in transcription, splicing and allele-specific expression across individuals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq, a massive parallel-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling method, provides digital data in the form of aligned sequence read counts. The comparative analyses of the data require appropriate statistical methods to estimate the differential expression of transcript variants across different cell/tissue types and disease conditions.
RESULTS: We developed a novel nonparametric empirical Bayesian-based approach (NPEBseq) to model the RNA-seq data. The prior distribution of the Bayesian model is empirically estimated from the data without any parametric assumption, and hence the method is "nonparametric" in nature. Based on this model, we proposed a method for detecting differentially expressed genes across different conditions. We also extended this method to detect differential usage of exons from RNA-seq data. The evaluation of NPEBseq on both simulated and publicly available RNA-seq datasets and comparison with three popular methods showed improved results for experiments with or without biological replicates.
CONCLUSIONS: NPEBseq can successfully detect differential expression between different conditions not only at gene level but also at exon level from RNA-seq datasets. In addition, NPEBSeq performs significantly better than current methods and can be applied to genome-wide RNA-seq datasets. Sample datasets and R package are available at http://bioinformatics.wistar.upenn.edu/NPEBseq.},

	abstract = {Next generation sequencing is quickly replacing microarrays as a technique to probe different molecular levels of the cell, such as DNA or RNA. The technology provides higher resolution, while reducing bias. RNA sequencing results in counts of RNA strands. This type of data imposes new statistical challenges. We present a novel, generic approach to model and analyze such data. Our approach aims at large flexibility of the likelihood (count) model and the regression model alike. Hence, a variety of count models is supported, such as the popular NB model, which accounts for overdispersion. In addition, complex, non-balanced designs and random effects are accommodated. Like some other methods, our method provides shrinkage of dispersion-related parameters. However, we extend it by enabling joint shrinkage of parameters, including those for which inference is desired. We argue that this is essential for Bayesian multiplicity correction. Shrinkage is effectuated by empirically estimating priors. We discuss several parametric (mixture) and non-parametric priors and develop procedures to estimate (parameters of) those. Inference is provided by means of local and Bayesian false discovery rates. We illustrate our method on several simulations and two data sets, also to compare it with other methods. Model- and data-based simulations show substantial improvements in the sensitivity at the given specificity. The data motivate the use of the ZI-NB as a powerful alternative to the NB, which results in higher detection rates for low-count data. Finally, compared with other methods, the results on small sample subsets are more reproducible when validated on their large sample complements, illustrating the importance of the type of shrinkage.},

As a marriage of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, MeRIP-Seq has the potential to study the transcriptome-wide distribution of various post-transcriptional RNA modifications.

Compared with other relatively well studied data types such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, the study of MeRIP-Seq data is still at very early stage, and existing protocols are not optimized for dealing with the intrinsic characteristic of MeRIP-Seq data. We therein provide here a detailed and easy-to-use protocol of using exomePeak R/Bioconductor package along with other software programs for analysis of MeRIP-Seq data, which covers raw reads alignment, RNA methylation site detection, motif discovery, differential RNA methylation analysis, and functional analysis.

RESULTS: We developed HEP, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based Exome Peak-finding algorithm for predicting transcriptome methylation sites using MeRIP-seq data. In contrast to exomePeak, our previously developed MeRIP-seq peak calling algorithm, HEPeak models the correlation between continuous bins in an m6A peak region and it is a model-based approach, which admits rigorous statistical inference. HEPeak was evaluated on a simulated MeRIP-seq dataset and achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than exomePeak. HEPeak was also applied to real MeRIP-seq datasets from human HEK293T cell line and mouse midbrain cells and was shown to be able to recapitulate known m6A distribution in transcripts and identify novel m6A sites in long non-coding RNAs.

	abstract = {BackgroundThe recently emerged technology of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) sheds light on the study of RNA epigenetics. This new bioinformatics question calls for effective and robust peaking calling algorithms to detect mRNA methylation sites from MeRIP-seq data.MethodsWe propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to detect methylation sites from MeRIP-seq data. Our modeling approach includes several important characteristics. First, it models the zero-inflated and over-dispersed counts by deploying a zero-inflated negative binomial model. Second, it incorporates a hidden Markov model (HMM) to account for the spatial dependency of neighboring read enrichment. Third, our Bayesian inference allows the proposed model to borrow strength in parameter estimation, which greatly improves the model stability when dealing with MeRIP-seq data with a small number of replicates. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to simultaneously infer the model parameters in a de novo fashion. The R Shiny demo is available at https://qiwei.shinyapps.io/BaySeqPeak and the R/C ++ code is available at https://github.com/liqiwei2000/BaySeqPeak.ResultsIn simulation studies, the proposed method outperformed the competing methods exomePeak and MeTPeak, especially when an excess of zeros were present in the data. In real MeRIP-seq data analysis, the proposed method identified methylation sites that were more consistent with biological knowledge, and had better spatial resolution compared to the other methods.ConclusionsIn this study, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify methylation peaks in MeRIP-seq data. The proposed method has a competitive edge over existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and spatial resolution.Open image in new window},
